// Package steamfiles deals with locally-installed Steam apps and their backups.
//
// It allows callers to find and examine installed Steam apps and backups of
// Steam apps in local storage.
//
// Steam can have more than one "Steam library folder".  Each such folder is
// rooted at a directory named "steamapps" (or perhaps "SteamApps"?).  That
// directory contains a text file named appmanifest_<N>.acf for each app
// installed there, where <N> is the appâ€™s numeric (decimal) ID.  These files
// are in the Valve Data Format (specifically in what I call the "simple VDF" in
// which all keys and final values are double-quoted strings).
//
// Steam backups are stored as a directory whose name reflects the apps in that
// backup.  (You can backup multiple apps together.)  A backup is divided into
// one or more subdirectories named "Disk_1", "Disk_2", etc. ...???... sku.sis
